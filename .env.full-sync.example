# ============================================
# Full Database Sync Configuration
# ============================================
# DEPRECATED 2026-02 (Phase 3, Issue #1063)
# This file is no longer needed - pricing sync has been removed.
# Pricing is now automatically synced via model sync every 30 minutes.
#
# Model sync (provider_model_sync_service.py) handles:
# - Fetching models from all 30+ providers
# - Updating pricing information in model_pricing table
# - Maintaining pricing history in model_pricing_history table
#
# No configuration needed - it runs automatically!
# ============================================

# To manually trigger a model sync (which includes pricing):
# curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/admin/model-sync/all

# To check model sync status:
# curl https://your-domain.com/admin/model-sync/status
