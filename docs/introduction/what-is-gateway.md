# What is the AI Gateway?

The AI Gateway is an open-source orchestration layer that exposes a unified REST API to many large language-model providers. It sits between your applications and upstream services, handling authentication, metering usage with credits, and enforcing security so you can focus on product development.

## Unified API for many models
Harness dozens of providers through a consistent interface. Switch models or route requests without changing your application code.

## Credit-based billing
Every request is metered through a token-based credit system, making it easy to cap usage and bill teams or customers.

## Built-in security
Keys are encrypted at rest, scoped to domains or IPs, and rotated automatically. Allowlists and audit logs help protect your workloads.

## Analytics and monitoring
Real-time dashboards and logs provide insight into model performance and cost. Track usage by user, model, or endpoint.
