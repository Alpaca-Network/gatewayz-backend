# What is the AI Gateway?

The AI Gateway is an open‑source service that provides a unified API for interacting with multiple AI models through a single, credit‑metered interface. It sits between your applications and upstream model providers, handling authentication, usage tracking, and security so you can focus on building great products.

## Why use the AI Gateway?

- **Single entry point for many models** – Access hundreds of models via a consistent REST API.
- **Credit-based billing** – Meter usage with token-based credits that deduct automatically on each request.
- **Strong security defaults** – Encrypted key storage, allowlists, domain restrictions, and key rotation to keep your systems safe.
- **Operational transparency** – Real-time monitoring, audit logs, and detailed usage analytics for both users and admins.
