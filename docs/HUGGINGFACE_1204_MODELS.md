# HuggingFace 1,204 Models - Multi-Sort Strategy Success! 🎉

**Date:** 2025-10-18
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE**
**Commit:** [0e8fcf8](https://github.com/Alpaca-Network/gatewayz-backend/commit/0e8fcf8)
**Achievement:** 1,000 → 1,204 models (20% increase)

---

## Summary

Successfully increased HuggingFace model count from 1,000 to **1,204 models** by implementing an intelligent multi-sort fetching strategy. This bypasses the API's 1000-model-per-request limit by fetching with multiple sort methods and merging unique results.

---

## The Problem

**User Request:** "hugging face shows 1000 models, but it should be 1375 approx"

**Investigation Results:**
- HuggingFace API has ~1,377 models total with `inference_provider=hf-inference`
- Single API request with `full=true` caps at 1,000 models
- Pagination with `offset` doesn't work with `inference_provider` filter
- **But different sort methods return different sets of models!**

---

## The Discovery

Testing revealed that using different sort methods provides access to different model sets:

```bash
# Test with sort=likes
curl "https://huggingface.co/api/models?inference_provider=hf-inference&limit=1000&full=true&sort=likes"
# Returns 1000 models

# Test with sort=downloads
curl "https://huggingface.co/api/models?inference_provider=hf-inference&limit=1000&full=true&sort=downloads"
# Returns 1000 models (but not the same 1000!)

# Overlap analysis:
# - Same models in both: 796
# - Unique in likes: 204
# - Unique in downloads: 204
# - Total unique: 1,204
```

**Key Insight:** By fetching with both sort methods and merging results, we can access 1,204 unique models!

## The Solution

### Multi-Sort Strategy

**File:** [src/services/huggingface_models.py](../src/services/huggingface_models.py:67-132)

```python
# Strategy: Use multiple sort methods to get different sets of models
# The API caps at 1000 per request, but different sorts return different models
# This allows us to fetch more than 1000 unique models by merging results
sort_methods = ['likes', 'downloads']  # These two sorts give us the best coverage

models = []
seen_model_ids = set()  # Track unique model IDs across all sort methods

for sort_method in sort_methods:
    logger.info(f"Fetching models with sort={sort_method}")

    params = {
        "inference_provider": "hf-inference",
        "limit": 1000,
        "full": "true",
        "sort": sort_method,
    }

    response = httpx.get(url, params=params, headers=headers, timeout=30.0)
    batch_models = response.json()

    # Deduplicate across all fetches
    for model in batch_models:
        model_id = model.get("id")
        if model_id and model_id not in seen_model_ids:
            seen_model_ids.add(model_id)
            models.append(model)
```

### How It Works

1. **First Request** - Fetch with `sort=likes` → 1,000 models
2. **Second Request** - Fetch with `sort=downloads` → 1,000 models (204 new)
3. **Deduplication** - Merge using `seen_model_ids` set
4. **Result** - 1,204 unique models (796 overlap + 204 unique from each)

## Impact

### Model Availability Progress

| Version | Models | Method | Commits |
|---------|--------|--------|---------|
| Initial | 100 | Default API | - |
| v1 | 1,000 | Added `full=true` | 6f031bd |
| v2 | **1,204** | **Multi-sort strategy** | **0e8fcf8** |
| Target | ~1,377 | (Total available) | - |

**Progress:** 1,204 / 1,377 = **87.4% coverage** of all available models

### Improvement Metrics

- **From 100 to 1,204:** +1,104 models (1,104% increase)
- **From 1,000 to 1,204:** +204 models (20.4% increase)
- **Remaining gap:** 173 models to reach full ~1,377 coverage

---

## Technical Details

### Why This Works

The HuggingFace API's `sort` parameter changes which models are prioritized in the 1000-model response:

- **sort=likes** - Prioritizes models with most likes (community favorites)
- **sort=downloads** - Prioritizes models with most downloads (most used)

These two metrics don't always correlate perfectly, so:
- High-like, low-download models appear only in `likes` results
- High-download, low-like models appear only in `downloads` results
- Popular models with both appear in both results (796 overlap)

### Deduplication Strategy

```python
seen_model_ids = set()  # O(1) lookup for duplicates

for model in batch_models:
    model_id = model.get("id")
    if model_id not in seen_model_ids:
        seen_model_ids.add(model_id)
        models.append(model)
        new_models_in_batch += 1
    else:
        duplicates_in_batch += 1
```

Benefits:
- **O(1) duplicate detection** using Python sets
- **Memory efficient** - only stores model IDs for deduplication
- **Preserves order** - models from `likes` sort appear first
- **Tracks statistics** - logs new vs duplicate counts

---

## Reaching 1,377 Models

### Remaining Gap: 173 Models

To fetch the remaining 173 models, we could:

#### Option 1: Add More Sort Methods
Test if other sort parameters provide unique models:
```python
sort_methods = ['likes', 'downloads', 'trending', 'created']
```

**Status:** Tested - `trending` and `created` return 400 errors with `inference_provider` filter

#### Option 2: Use Different Filters
Try fetching without `inference_provider` filter and filter client-side:
```python
# Fetch all models, filter for hf-inference compatibility
params = {"limit": 10000, "full": "true"}
# Then check each model's tags for 'endpoints_compatible'
```

**Downside:** Would fetch many unusable models, slower

#### Option 3: Scrape from HuggingFace Website
Parse https://huggingface.co/models?inference_provider=hf-inference directly

**Downside:** Fragile, violates API best practices

#### Option 4: Contact HuggingFace
Request API enhancement or clarification on fetching all models

**Best long-term solution**

### Current Recommendation

**Accept 1,204 models as excellent coverage (87.4%)**

Reasons:
- The 204 additional models from multi-sort are likely the most relevant
- Remaining 173 models are probably less popular/used
- Multi-sort strategy is clean, maintainable, and fast
- No API abuse or fragile scraping required

---

## Performance

### Request Count
- **Old approach:** 1 request (1000 models)
- **New approach:** 2 requests (1204 models)
- **Trade-off:** 1 extra request for 204 more models (20% increase)

### Response Time
```
Request 1 (sort=likes):    ~2-3 seconds
Request 2 (sort=downloads): ~2-3 seconds
Total:                     ~4-6 seconds
```

**Still very fast** for 1,204 models with full metadata.

### Cache Efficiency
```python
# Results cached for 1 hour (3600 seconds)
_huggingface_models_cache["ttl"] = 3600

# Subsequent requests use cache (instant response)
if cache_age < ttl:
    return _huggingface_models_cache["data"]
```

## Code Changes

### Before (Single Sort)
```python
params = {
    "inference_provider": "hf-inference",
    "limit": 1000,
    "full": "true",
}

response = httpx.get(url, params=params, headers=headers)
models = response.json()  # Max 1000 models
```

### After (Multi-Sort)
```python
sort_methods = ['likes', 'downloads']
models = []
seen_model_ids = set()

for sort_method in sort_methods:
    params = {
        "inference_provider": "hf-inference",
        "limit": 1000,
        "full": "true",
        "sort": sort_method,
    }

    response = httpx.get(url, params=params, headers=headers)
    batch_models = response.json()

    for model in batch_models:
        if model['id'] not in seen_model_ids:
            seen_model_ids.add(model['id'])
            models.append(model)

# Result: 1204 unique models
```

## Logging Output

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Try Additional Sort Methods
If HuggingFace adds more sort options that work with `inference_provider`:
```python
sort_methods = ['likes', 'downloads', 'new_sort_method']
```

### 2. Periodic Model Discovery
Run a background job to discover new models:
```python
# Check for new models daily
if last_check > 24_hours:
    new_models = fetch_models_from_huggingface_api(use_cache=False)
    notify_if_new_models_found(new_models)
```

### 3. Model Quality Filtering
Filter out low-quality models:
```python
def is_high_quality(model):
    return (model['huggingface_metrics']['downloads'] > 100 and
            model['huggingface_metrics']['likes'] > 5 and
            not model['huggingface_metrics']['private'])
```
