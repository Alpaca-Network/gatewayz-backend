# Production Deployment Guide

**Date:** October 15, 2025  
**Purpose:** Deploy gateway testing updates and enable 4 new gateway integrations

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Add Environment Variables to Railway

Log into Railway dashboard and add these 4 new environment variables:

```bash
FEATHERLESS_API_KEY=your-featherless-api-key
GROQ_API_KEY=your-groq-api-key
FIREWORKS_API_KEY=your-fireworks-api-key
TOGETHER_API_KEY=your-together-api-key
```

### Step 2: Trigger Railway Redeploy

Railway will automatically deploy when it detects the GitHub push. If not:

1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Click "Deploy" or "Redeploy"
4. Wait for deployment to complete (~2-3 minutes)

### Step 3: Verify Deployment

Once deployed, test the production API endpoints:

```bash
# Test OpenRouter (should already work)
curl "https://api.gatewayz.ai/catalog/models?gateway=openrouter&limit=3"

# Test new gateways
curl "https://api.gatewayz.ai/catalog/models?gateway=groq&limit=3"
curl "https://api.gatewayz.ai/catalog/models?gateway=fireworks&limit=3"
curl "https://api.gatewayz.ai/catalog/models?gateway=together&limit=3"
curl "https://api.gatewayz.ai/catalog/models?gateway=featherless&limit=3"
```

## ✅ Expected Results After Deployment

All 7 gateways should return model data:

| Gateway | Expected Models | Status |
|---------|----------------|--------|
| OpenRouter | 334 | Already working |
| Portkey | 500 | Already working |
| Chutes | 104 | Already working |
| **Featherless** | **6,398** | ✨ NEW |
| **Together** | **100** | ✨ NEW |
| **Fireworks** | **38** | ✨ NEW |
| **Groq** | **19** | ✨ NEW |
| **TOTAL** | **~7,500+** | 🎉 |

## 🧪 Post-Deployment Testing

Run the automated test suite against production:

```bash
# Update test_all_gateways.py to use production URL
# Change: BASE_URL = "http://localhost:8000"
# To:     BASE_URL = "https://api.gatewayz.ai"

python test_all_gateways.py
```

## 📊 What Changed

### New Files
- `test_all_gateways.py` - Automated gateway testing suite
- `test_api_keys.py` - API key validation tool
- `docs/GATEWAY_TEST_RESULTS.md` - Test results documentation
- `docs/GATEWAY_TEST_RESULTS_FINAL.md` - Final analysis
- `docs/PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT.md` - This file

### Updated Files
- `.env` - Added 4 new API keys locally

### Environment Variables Added
- `FEATHERLESS_API_KEY` - For Featherless.ai gateway
- `GROQ_API_KEY` - For Groq gateway
- `FIREWORKS_API_KEY` - For Fireworks.ai gateway
- `TOGETHER_API_KEY` - For Together.ai gateway

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If endpoints return 404

**Problem:** Catalog endpoints not found  
**Solution:** Ensure latest code is deployed from GitHub

```bash
# Check deployment logs in Railway
# Verify the commit hash matches latest push
```

### If endpoints return 503

**Problem:** Gateway unavailable  
**Solution:** Check environment variables are set in Railway

```bash
# Verify in Railway dashboard:
# Settings > Variables
# All 4 new keys should be present
```

### If API keys don't work

**Problem:** Invalid or expired keys  
**Solution:** Test keys locally first

```bash
# Run validation script
python test_api_keys.py

# All 4 should show "✓ Success"
```

## 📝 Rollback Plan

If deployment causes issues:

1. **Quick Fix:** Remove the 4 new environment variables
2. **Full Rollback:** Revert to previous commit in Railway
3. **Investigation:** Check Railway logs for errors

## 🎯 Success Criteria

Deployment is successful when:

- ✅ All 7 gateway endpoints return 200 OK
- ✅ Each gateway returns expected number of models
- ✅ No 404 or 503 errors
- ✅ Production tests pass with automated suite
