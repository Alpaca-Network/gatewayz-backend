### 7. ✅ Coverage Enforcement in CI

**Files Updated:**
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- `pytest.ini`

**Changes:**
1. **CI Pipeline (`ci.yml`):**
   - ✅ Added `pytest-cov` installation
   - ✅ Run tests with coverage tracking (`--cov=src`)
   - ✅ Generate coverage reports (term, XML, HTML)
   - ✅ Enforce 80% coverage threshold (`--cov-fail-under=80`)
   - ✅ Upload coverage reports as artifacts
   - ✅ Optional Codecov integration

2. **Pytest Configuration (`pytest.ini`):**
   - ✅ Added `fail_under = 80` in `[coverage:report]`
   - ✅ Added `show_missing = True` to highlight uncovered lines
   - ✅ Added exclusion patterns for common non-testable code
   - ✅ Added test markers: `smoke`, `contract`, `e2e`
   - ✅ Configured HTML coverage report directory

**CI Coverage Gate:**
```yaml
- name: Check coverage threshold
  run: |
    pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=term --cov-fail-under=80 --co -q || {
      echo "❌ Coverage is below 80% threshold"
      echo "📊 Run 'pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=html' locally to see detailed coverage report"
      exit 1
    }
```

**Local Usage:**
```bash
# Run tests with coverage
pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=html

# Open coverage report
open htmlcov/index.html

# Check if coverage meets threshold
pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-fail-under=80
```
