# Email Security Best Practices

## üîí Security Considerations

### API Key Protection
**CRITICAL**: API keys are never included in email content for security reasons.

#### Why API Keys Should Not Be in Emails:
1. **Email Interception**: Emails can be intercepted in transit
2. **Email Storage**: Emails are often stored in multiple locations
3. **Email Forwarding**: Users might forward emails containing sensitive data
4. **Email Clients**: Various email clients may not be secure
5. **Compliance**: Many security standards prohibit sending credentials via email

#### Secure API Key Delivery:
- ‚úÖ **Dashboard Access**: API keys are only accessible through authenticated dashboard
- ‚úÖ **Secure Storage**: Keys are stored encrypted in the database
- ‚úÖ **Access Logging**: All API key access is logged and monitored
- ‚úÖ **Rotation Support**: Keys can be rotated without email re-sending

### Email Security Features

#### 1. Welcome Emails
- **No API Key Exposure**: Users are directed to dashboard to retrieve their key
- **Secure Instructions**: Clear guidance on where to find API keys
- **Dashboard Links**: Direct links to secure key management

#### 2. Password Reset Emails
- **Token-Based**: Uses secure, time-limited tokens
- **Expiration**: Tokens expire in 1 hour
- **Single Use**: Tokens can only be used once
- **No Password Storage**: Passwords are never stored in plain text

#### 3. API Key Creation Notifications
- **No Key Exposure**: Only notifies that a key was created
- **Dashboard Access**: Directs users to secure dashboard
- **Security Warnings**: Clear security messaging

#### 4. Account Security Alerts
- **Suspicious Activity**: Alerts for unusual account behavior
- **Login Notifications**: Notify of new device logins
- **Security Changes**: Alert when security settings change

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Implementation

### Email Template Security
```python
# SECURE: No API key in email content
def welcome_email(self, username: str, email: str, credits: int):
    content = f"""
    <h2>Welcome to {self.app_name}! üéâ</h2>
    <p>Your API key is available in your dashboard. For security reasons, we don't include API keys in emails.</p>
    <div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;">
        <a href="{self.app_url}/dashboard" class="cta-button">üîê View API Key in Dashboard</a>
    </div>
    """
```

### Database Security
- **Encrypted Storage**: API keys are encrypted at rest
- **Access Controls**: Row-level security for user data
- **Audit Logging**: All key access is logged
- **Token Expiration**: Password reset tokens have short lifespans

### Email Delivery Security
- **TLS Encryption**: All emails sent over encrypted connections
- **SPF/DKIM**: Email authentication to prevent spoofing
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents email abuse
- **Bounce Handling**: Proper handling of undeliverable emails

## üìã Security Checklist

### ‚úÖ Implemented Security Measures
- [x] No API keys in email content
- [x] Secure password reset tokens
- [x] Encrypted email delivery
- [x] Dashboard-only key access
- [x] Security warnings in emails
- [x] Audit logging for key access
- [x] Token expiration handling
- [x] Rate limiting on email endpoints

### üîÑ Ongoing Security Tasks
- [ ] Regular security audits
- [ ] Email delivery monitoring
- [ ] User security education
- [ ] Incident response procedures
- [ ] Security testing and validation

## üö® Security Incident Response

### If API Key is Compromised:
1. **Immediate Revocation**: Revoke the compromised key
2. **User Notification**: Send security alert email
3. **Access Review**: Review recent API usage
4. **New Key Generation**: Generate replacement key
5. **Security Audit**: Review security practices

### If Email is Compromised:
1. **Password Reset**: Force password reset for affected users
2. **Session Termination**: Terminate all active sessions
3. **Security Review**: Review account security settings
4. **Monitoring**: Increase monitoring for suspicious activity

## üìö Security Resources

### Best Practices
- **Never send credentials via email**
- **Use secure, time-limited tokens**
- **Implement proper access controls**
- **Monitor and log all access**
- **Regular security audits**

### Compliance
- **GDPR**: Personal data protection
- **SOC 2**: Security controls
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management
- **PCI DSS**: Payment card security (if applicable)

## üîß Configuration

### Secure Email Settings
```bash
# Environment Variables
RESEND_API_KEY=your_secure_resend_key
FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com
APP_URL=https://yourdomain.com
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_encryption_key
```

### Database Security
```sql
-- Enable RLS on sensitive tables
ALTER TABLE users ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE api_keys ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE password_reset_tokens ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create security policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can only access their own data" ON users
    FOR ALL USING (id::text = auth.uid()::text);
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Security Notes

1. **API Keys**: Never include API keys in email content
2. **Passwords**: Never send passwords via email
3. **Tokens**: Use short-lived, single-use tokens
4. **Encryption**: Always use encrypted connections
5. **Monitoring**: Monitor all security-related activities
6. **Updates**: Keep security measures up to date

The email system is designed with security as a top priority, ensuring that sensitive information is never exposed through email communications.
